# PartyFinderPlus

PartyFinderPlus is a simple mod with a simple goal - improve the Hypixel Skyblock Party Finder experience as much as possible.
Currently, PartyFinderPlus has an intricate auto-kick feature for getting rid of low-level players quickly and easily.

**Auto-kick Settings:**

Secret Minimum - Sets the minimum amount of secrets somebody needs to join your party.

Require Necron Blade - Requires a Necron Blade (Hyperion, Scylla, Astraea, Valkyrie) to join your party.

Require Terminator - Requires a Terminator to join your party.

Require Terminator As Archer - Only require a Terminator to join if the person trying to join is playing Archer class.

Class-specific - Set specific classes to be automatically kicked

**Autokicker requires a valid Hypixel API key!**
